Note 1: when you change a model, after you do makemigrations/migrate locally and commit the changes to github, immediately after re-deploying to heroku ("git push heroku master") you need to run "heroku run bash" to pop open the heroku bash script, then type your usual "python3 manage.py migrate" on the heroku command line and hit enter. This will migrate the database model changes you made locally to the Postgres production server. If you forget to do this, it WILL break the site, every time.
